# Mini Mart

*USING C PROGRAM*

A mini mart needs to computerize the items that they are selling. The items in the mini mart consists of Item Codes, Description, Quantity and Price. Write a program using C programming to store the items in a single linked list, ordered based on the Item Code. The system should be menu driven, where the main menu is as follows:

# Option 1:
 Adding the items into the linked list. Note that when adding new items, you must check at which position that the items need to be inserted. The resulting list should always be in sorting order by Item number.

# Option 2: 
 Display all items in the list.

# Option 3: 
 Given an item code, find the items in the list. If found, then edit the data. If the item is not found, then write a message that the item doesn’t exists.  

# Option 4: 
 Delete one item from given item code, find the items in the list. If found, then delete the data. If the item is not found, then write a message that the item doesn’t exists.

# Option 5:
 Exit the program
